# -Road-Accident-Excel-Project
I built an interactive Road Accident Dashboard using Microsoft Excel to analyze accident data across urban and rural areas for the years 2021 and 2022. This project enhanced my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling.


# 🎯Ojectives:
1. **Filters for year and location type (urban/rural).**
2. **KPIs for fatal, serious, and slight casualties.**
3. **Casualty breakdown by vehicle type, road type, road surface, and light condition.**
4. **Monthly trend line charts comparing current vs previous year.**
5. **Clean, dark-themed visual layout with slicers and charts.**

# 🧩 Problem Statement
Despite numerous safety measures, road accidents continue to cause a high number of casualties every year. Government agencies and road safety authorities need actionable insights to identify risk factors and reduce accident rates. However, raw data alone doesn't provide a clear picture of where and why these accidents occur.

 # Detailed Report
**📊 Key Insights:**

-- **🚗 Cars caused 79.8% of total casualties.**
**💀 Fatalities: 7,135 (1.7%) | Serious: 59,312 (14.2%) | Slight: 351,435 (84.1%).**
**🛣️ Highest casualties occurred on Single carriageways (~310K).**
**☀️ Daylight conditions saw nearly 73% of total incidents.**
**📍 Urban areas recorded 255.9K casualties, higher than rural areas.**
**📅 Monthly trends compared across 2021 & 2022 for better decision-making.**

# ✅ Conclusion
This Road Accident Dashboard project provided valuable hands-on experience in analyzing real-world data using Microsoft Excel. By transforming raw accident data into an interactive, visually engaging dashboard, I was able to uncover key insights such as the high percentage of casualties caused by cars, the dominance of accidents on single carriageways, and the impact of daylight and urban areas on accident rates.
The use of slicers, KPIs, and dynamic charts enabled a deeper understanding of trends over the years 2021 and 2022. This project not only strengthened my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling but also emphasized the importance of data-driven decision-making in public safety and transportation planning.

Going forward, I aim to apply these analytical techniques to more complex datasets and tools like Power BI or Tableau for advanced dashboards and reporting.
