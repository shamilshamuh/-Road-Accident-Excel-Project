# -Road-Accident-Excel-Project
I built an interactive Road Accident Dashboard using Microsoft Excel to analyze accident data across urban and rural areas for the years 2021 and 2022. This project enhanced my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling.

# Dashboard Highlights:
1.Filters for year and location type (urban/rural)
2.KPIs for fatal, serious, and slight casualties
3.Casualty breakdown by vehicle type, road type, road surface, and light condition
4.Monthly trend line charts comparing current vs previous year
5.Clean, dark-themed visual layout with slicers and charts
